## Input

Verbatim copy: <WORKDIR>/tmp/input.md (input_sha 188b9a240d85). Summary: medium widget compact two-line rows (client + 5H bar + 7D bar; account + resets under own bars), large unchanged; fit by height, +k overflow, ≥2 accounts at medium; stop after S5 with medium/large preview PNGs in <WORKDIR>/tmp/ before S6; README widget text + demo-screenshot alt text; make check + CI.

## Verify

`make check`
CI checks: ["make check"]

## Progress log

- S1: mode=stay, branch TASK-641-widget-5h-7d, base_ref 2a68a41.
- decision(layout): compact span = Metrics.row + Metrics.reset when the row has an account or a reset, else Metrics.row; compact divider 7 pt so 3 two-line accounts fit 155 − 2·16 = 123 pt (3·36 + 2·7 = 122). Large Metrics untouched.
- decision(+k compact): +k sits at the left of the last row's second line; needs its own line (Metrics.more) when that row has an account or no second line.
- decision(copy): reset text stays `resets in …` (requirement: copy identical to large; the mock's shortened text is illustrative).
- decision(family): view picks compact from `@Environment(\.widgetFamily) == .systemMedium`.
- S5 task 1 done: fb84dca red=12 (compile: compactDivider, fit(compact:), secondLine, compactMoreRoom missing); checks: make swift-test, make app, make test, make pii-scan all exit 0.
- decision(compactMoreRoom): separate function, not a defaulted `compact:` on moreRoom, so the large tests' `.map(moreRoom)` stay unchanged.
- decision(compact BarRow): spacing 4, label padding 4, ⚠ 12 pt, percent 13 pt so each bar keeps ~30 pt of track at 310 pt content width.
- HOLD before S6 (requirement preview gate): previews <WORKDIR>/tmp/preview-medium.png, preview-large.png (renderer <WORKDIR>/tmp/preview/). Resume S6 r1 only after the user approves.
- user requirement (2026-10-17, via commander, after preview 1): medium bars longer; no red ⚠ in medium (large keeps it; red bar still marks ≥90%); use freed space plus anything reasonable; keep everything else; re-render previews, stop again before S6.
- merge origin/main (TASK-640 alerts) clean; base_ref → bee2936 (merge-base).
- S5 task 2 done: 77b2783 red=none (view-only; swift-test has no view coverage); checks: make swift-test, make app, make test, make pii-scan exit 0. Medium bar track ~30 → ~50 pt.
- decision(longer bars): drop compact ⚠ and its spacing (16 pt/bar); compact title column 0.2 → 0.18 width. Side effect: a long account on a line whose 5H shows a reset truncates sooner.
- HOLD again before S6: previews re-rendered at the same paths.
- user requirement round 2 (2026-10-17, via commander): medium reset text `resets: ` + d h m without leading zero units, large unchanged, swift-test cases; medium bars a little longer; client column such that the fake accounts show in full; report how many chars of a 19-char outlook-style account fit; re-render, stop again before S6.
- S5 task 3 done: d4f9531 red=4 (compile: compactResetText missing, rows/content compact: missing); checks: make swift-test, make app, make test, make pii-scan exit 0.
- decision(compact text): Provider picks the formatter by context.family; rows/content get `compact: Bool = false`, so Bar stays a string and large tests are unchanged.
- decision(widths): compact title column fixed 52 pt (`claude` 15 pt bold = 49 pt measured); column gap 6; account–reset spacing 4; BarRow compact spacing 3, label padding 3. Bar track ~49 → ~57 pt at 310 pt content.
- measured (ImageRenderer, caption2 ≈ 6.1 pt/char): account room = 177 pt − the 5H reset width. a 19-character outlook-style address = 116 pt: fits beside `resets: 38m` (60 pt); ~17 chars beside `resets: 2h 9m`; ~16 beside the widest `resets: 4h 59m` (75 pt); ~29 with no 5H reset.
- HOLD again before S6: previews re-rendered at the same paths.
- user approved round-2 preview (d4f9531), incl. 19-char account losing 2–3 chars beside a 5H reset and trailing zero units (`4d 6h 0m`). Proceed to S6.
- S6 panel: pinned=[correctness,requirement-fidelity,doc,verification] verification=ci transport=Workflow
- S6 r1 @d4f9531: correctness=PASS requirement-fidelity=FAIL doc=PASS verification=PASS (command=CI make check, ci-verdict exit 0) -> requirement-fidelity#1 stale `⚠ claude` (67 pt) truncated in the 52 pt medium title column; fixing
- user requirement (2026-10-17, via commander, during r1): large uses the same reset text as medium (`resets: 2h 9m` / `resets: 4d 6h 0m`), one formatter; update large swift-test expectations, README, demo alt text; re-render large preview; no preview stop; review rounds must cover it; report done with draft PR.
- S6 r1 fix: 75895a3 (medium title column 68 pt while any visible row is stale, else 52; stale preview checked at tmp/stale/preview-medium-stale.png).
- S5 task 4 done (user change): one formatter: resetText is `resets: ` + d h m without leading zero units for both sizes; compactResetText, rows/content `compact:` and the provider's family switch removed. red=16 (reset_text, reset_lines, load_valid expectations). checks: make swift-test, make app, make test, make pii-scan exit 0. Previews re-rendered.
- S6 r2 re-review set: full panel (task 4 changes code, tests and README after r1).
- S6 r2 @58ed64e: correctness=PASS requirement-fidelity=PASS doc=PASS verification=PASS (command=CI make check, ci-verdict exit 0) -> converged
- residual NON-BLOCKING: doc#1 README.md:5 alt text says the bars sit "side by side on one line in the medium widget", while README.md:56 says two lines per account; suggest "side by side in a two-line group".

## Review items

- r1 requirement-fidelity#1 (BLOCKING) [req-drop] AgentUsageMonitorWidget.swift:199 medium title column fixed 52 pt; a stale title `⚠ claude` is 67 pt (`⚠ codex` ~63) so it truncates to `⚠ cl…`, while large shows it in full; ⚠/stale rules must match large.
- r1 correctness#1 (NON-BLOCKING) AgentUsageMonitorWidget.swift:130 same: `⚠ claude` cut to `⚠ cl…` in medium; widen when the title starts with ⚠ or size to `⚠ claude`.
- r1 verification#1 (NON-BLOCKING) CI at d4f9531 passed: make check.
- r2 correctness#1 RESOLVED; requirement-fidelity#1 RESOLVED (titleWidth 68 pt while a stale row shows).
- r2 doc#1 (NON-BLOCKING) README.md:5 alt text "side by side on one line in the medium widget" vs README.md:56 "two lines"; reword to "side by side in a two-line group".
- r2 verification#1 (NON-BLOCKING) CI at 58ed64e passed: make check.

## Notes

- Swift: macos/Widget/Snapshot.swift (model, Metrics, fit, moreRoom; Foundation only), macos/Widget/AgentUsageMonitorWidget.swift (SwiftUI views), tests macos/Tests/main.swift (`make swift-test`, assert-based).
- No CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md in repo. Commit style: `TASK-<n>: <summary>`; design docs in docs/design/TASK-<n>-<slug>-plan.md.
- README "## Widget"-ish paragraph at README.md:56; demo alt text README.md:5.
- Preview: `sed 's/^@main$//'` the widget file into tmp/preview/widget.swift, `xcrun swiftc -parse-as-library Snapshot.swift widget.swift preview.swift`, run with the out dir; ImageRenderer works with CLT.
- Demo screenshot: medium ≈ 342×157 content ≈ 308×125.

## Task list

Global Constraints: large layout, Metrics values, and existing tests unchanged; Foundation only in Snapshot.swift; no mutation testing.

### Task 1: Compact medium layout

- Files: macos/Widget/Snapshot.swift, macos/Widget/AgentUsageMonitorWidget.swift, macos/Tests/main.swift, README.md.
- Produces: `Metrics.compactDivider`; `DisplayRow.secondLine: Bool`; `fit(_:height:compact: Bool = false)`; `moreRoom(_:compact: Bool = false)`; `AccountList(display:width:compact:)`.
- Tests first: fit_compact with the screenshot's 3 accounts (claude 5H 0 no reset / 7D 100 reset, you@example.com; claude 25/24 both resets, work@example.com; codex 7D only 0 reset, you@example.com) at 155 − 2·16 → ≥2 (expect 3 rows, more 0); compact exact/short boundaries; compact moreRoom (account → k; reset only → 0; no second line → k); large fit results unchanged.
- Checks: `make swift-test`, `make app` (compiles the widget).
- Commit: `TASK-641: medium widget shows 5H and 7D side by side, two lines per account`

### Task 2: No warning triangle in medium, longer bars

- Files: macos/Widget/AgentUsageMonitorWidget.swift, README.md.
- Compact BarRow drops the ⚠ slot; compact title column 0.18; README medium text and demo alt text say the triangle is large-only.
- Checks: `make swift-test`, `make app`; re-render previews.
- Commit: `TASK-641: no warning triangle in the medium widget, longer bars`

### Task 3: Medium reset text in d h m, longer bars

- Files: macos/Widget/Snapshot.swift, macos/Widget/AgentUsageMonitorWidget.swift, macos/Tests/main.swift, README.md.
- Produces: `compactResetText(_:now:)`; `rows(_:now:compact:)`, `content(_:now:compact:)`.
- Tests first: compact_reset_text cases (1m, 38m, 1h 0m, 2h 9m, 23h 59m, 1d 0h 0m, 6d 0h 5m, 6d 1h 1m; nil/now/past nil); compact rows/content carry it.
- Commit: `TASK-641: medium reset text in d h m, longer bars, account column fits the account`

### Task 4: One reset text for both sizes

- Files: macos/Widget/Snapshot.swift, macos/Widget/AgentUsageMonitorWidget.swift, macos/Tests/main.swift, README.md.
- resetText → `resets: ` + d h m without leading zero units; drop compactResetText and the compact formatter plumbing; large test expectations, README widget text and demo alt text follow.
- Commit: `TASK-641: one reset text for both sizes: resets: 2h 9m, resets: 4d 6h 0m`
